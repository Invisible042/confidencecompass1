## ✅ What You Want to Build (Recap)

An AI app that, **in real-time**, can:

1. Track **eye contact & facial expressions** – with Mediapipe / OpenCV
2. Detect **filler words** – with Whisper / Deepgram / OpenAI
3. Detect **fast speech** – by analyzing WPM
4. Detect **voice tremble** – using pitch/jitter features
5. Give **live feedback or dashboard results**

## 🚀 What You Need to Build (Yourself)

| Component           | Tool/Library                          | What to Do                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Face & Eye Tracking | `Mediapipe` + `OpenCV`                | Capture webcam frames, track eyes & face landmarks |
| Speech Input        | Browser → Backend                     | Use `getUserMedia()` to stream mic to backend      |
| Transcription       | `OpenAI Whisper` / `Deepgram`         | Convert speech to text, extract filler words       |
| Speed/Pacing        | Python script                         | Count words per minute (WPM) from timestamps       |
| Voice Tremble       | `Librosa`, `praat-parselmouth`        | Analyze pitch variations from audio chunks         |
| Backend             | `FastAPI`                             | Connect all components, return results             |
| Hosting             | `Hugging Face`, `Replit`, or `Render` | Free-tier deploy to test your app online           |

## 🧪 Want to Start With...?

Just tell me what part you want first:

### A) 👁️ Face + Eye Tracking

Start with Mediapipe + webcam + eye contact heatmap

### B) 🎤 Speech to Text + Filler Detection

Use Whisper or Deepgram to get transcript + flag “um”, “uh”

### C) 🔊 Pacing + Tremble Detection

Measure speaking speed & jitter in voice with Librosa

### D) 🌐 All Together: FastAPI Backend

Tie it all together in one app that gives speaker feedback
