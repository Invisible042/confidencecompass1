## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Python 3.11+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
setup-server.bat
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-server.sh
./setup-server.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd confidencecompass1-main
   ```

2. **Easy Setup** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   npm run start-dev
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Install dependencies if needed
   - Create a `.env` file with placeholder values
   - Start the development server

3. **Manual Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Create .env file (see SETUP.md for details)
   # Start the server
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## üîß Configuration

### Required API Keys

You'll need to set up these services and add their API keys to your `.env` file:

- **LiveKit** (Real-time communication): [Get from LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/)
- **Deepgram** (Speech-to-text & TTS): [Get from Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/)
- **OpenRouter** (AI conversation): [Get from OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)

See `SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## üéØ What Works Without Database
